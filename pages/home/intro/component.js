              Did you know? Glogally, soils, hold at least two trillion tonnes of organic carbon;
              around three times as much as the atmosphere.

              But due to agriculture, the worldâ€™s soils have lost 130 billion tons of organic
              carbon. That means more carbon in the atmosphere, less productive soil for crops to
              grow in, and reduced ability for soil to clean water.
