        <p>Soils Revealed can help you find places with the greatest potential to increase soil organic carbon and advance food security, water quality and climate action.</p>
        <h2>Did you know? Glogally, soils, hold at least two trillion tonnes of organic carbon; around three times as much as the atmosphere.</h2>
        <p>But due to agriculture, the worldâ€™s soils have lost 130 billion tons of organic carbon. That means more carbon in the atmosphere, less productive soil for crops to grow in, and reduced ability for soil to clean water.</p>
